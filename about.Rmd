## Bio

I am the Associate Science Director for University Engagement and a Senior Research Scientist in Data61, where I tackle a wide range of applied problems with innovative solutions. 

I hold a PhD in statistics and have been recognised as a recipient of the APAC Women in AI Awards for the Environment and Biodiversity category, and first runner-up for Innovator of the Year for my innovated methods developed for monitoring the status and trends of pollutants in the Great Barrier Reef. 

I am passionate about science communication and developing methodologies that are relevant to solving real-world problems. My work focuses on creating data workflows that deliver trusted scientific outputs, often using visualisations as a medium to communicate findings. 

I have supervised several students and postdoctoral research fellows and hold adjunct appointments at the School of Computer Science at the Australian National University and the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology. I am passionate about providing unique STEM opportunities for women.
