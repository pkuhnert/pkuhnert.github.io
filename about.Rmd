## Bio
  
I am a Data Scientist in CSIRO's Data61 and lead the Hybrid Prediction Activity in CSIRO's Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platform (MLAI FSP). 

I have a PhD in applied statistics, focussing on quantifying and communicating uncertainty to decision-makers, the development of non-linear space-time analytics that utilises machine learning algorithms for environmental problems, and developing emulation approaches for speeding up slow running process models.

I really enjoy creating new visualisations to explore and understand data. I think visualisation is the key to understanding complex data and can lead to more trusted datasets and analyses.

I am part of the STEM professionals in schools program and enjoy interacting with schools to get students interested in mathematics, statistics and computing.
